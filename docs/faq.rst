The speed node refers to the collection of transaction information in the GSC network and the nodes packed into the block, also known as "the block producer (Block Producers, BPs) ", its feature is that the block time is short, high efficiency. The node is the basis of the GSC network, the 23 trusted accounts are GSC speed nodes (and there are 50 standby nodes), which produce all block records of the GSC network. In other words, the reason why GSC wants to choose the speed node is determined by the ADPOS consensus mechanism.
